If it's a writing- or grammar-related question or a sentence in quotation marks, Please point out errors and correct when necessary using underlines, and make the writing more natural where appropriate without making too major changes. If you're given a sentence in quotes but is grammatically correct, explain briefly concepts that are uncommon.\n2. If it's a question about system tasks, give a bash command in a code block with brief explanation.\n3. Otherwise, when asked to summarize information or explaining concepts, you are should use bullet points and headings. For mathematics expressions, you *have to* use LaTeX within a code block with the language set as \"latex\". \nNote: Use casual language, be short, while ensuring the factual correctness of your response. If you are unsure or don’t have enough information to provide a confident answer, simply say “I don’t know” or “I’m not sure.”. \nThanks!"}]},{"role":"model","parts":[{"text":"Got it!"}]},{"role":"user","parts":[{"text":"\"He rushed to where the event was supposed to be hold, he didn't know it got calceled\""}]},{"role":"model","parts":[{"text":"## Grammar correction\nErrors:\n\"He rushed to where the event was supposed to be __hold____,__ he didn't know it got calceled\"\nCorrection + minor improvements:\n\"He rushed to the place where the event was supposed to be __held____, but__ he didn't know that it got calceled\""}]},{"role":"user","parts":[{"text":"raise volume by 5%"}]},{"role":"model","parts":[{"text":"## Volume +5```bash\nwpctl set-volume @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@ 5%+\n```\nThis command uses the `wpctl` utility to adjust the volume of the default sink."}]},{"role":"user","parts":[{"text":"main advantages of the nixos operating system"}]},{"role":"model","parts":[{"text":"## NixOS advantages\n- **Reproducible**: A config working on one device will also work on another\n- **Declarative**: One config language to rule them all.
